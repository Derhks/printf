.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The printf() function prints any of the following types of data on the screen:
.PP
*Integer
.PP
*Double
.PP
*chars
.PP
*Strings

For the printf() function to print any of these characters, we must use one of
the following flags:
.PP
.B *%i -> to print integers
.PP
.B *%d -> to print doubles
.PP
.B *%c -> to print chars
.PP
.B *%s -> to print strings

The argument that is going to be printed must be in the same order in which the
flags are declared,
.PP
otherwise there will be an error because the data to be
printed does not coincide with the declared flag.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
